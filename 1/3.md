## Automation

Automation refers to the use of technology to perform tasks with minimal human intervention. It can involve the use of software, machinery, or systems to carry out processes automatically, improving efficiency, accuracy, and productivity. Automation can be applied across various domains, including manufacturing, IT, business processes, and everyday tasks.

Documentation: Requirements documents, design specifications, user manuals, etc.

Code: Source code files, libraries, and modules.

Build Artifacts: Compiled binaries, executables, and packages generated from the source code.

Test Artifacts: Test plans, test cases, test scripts, and test results.

Deployment Artifacts: Configuration files, scripts, and container images used for deploying applications.

2. Project Management:

## jFrog Artifactory

Place where oraganaization can store their custom libraries

JFrog Artifactory is a universal artifact repository manager that plays a crucial role in automation within the DevOps lifecycle. It serves as a central hub for managing binaries and artifacts, facilitating end-to-end automation in software development and deployment processes.

## Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker for storing and sharing Docker images. It serves as a central repository where developers can publish their container images, making them accessible for deployment and collaboration. Docker Hub supports features like automated builds, webhooks, and integration with CI/CD pipelines, which facilitate the development and deployment processes.

## Containers

A Docker container is a lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient unit that encapsulates an application and all its dependencies, allowing it to run consistently across different computing environments. Containers are built from Docker images, which are read-only templates that define the application and its environment.

Container means a process
