# Software building process

### Requirements

1. Technical

2. Non-technical

### Design

1. Desktop, web based app

2. Language

3. Technologies

### Implementation of the code

1. Code

2. Test

### Deployment process

1. Should be accessible at same time for all customers

2. Instances required

## Instance

An instance in cloud computing refers to a virtual server that is created and managed within a cloud environment. It allows users to run applications and store data without the need for physical hardware. Instances can be customized based on resource requirements, such as CPU, memory, and storage, and are provided by cloud service providers.

An instance of an application is a specific execution of that application. It can be thought of as a running copy of the application that operates independently of other copies.

When deploying applications in the cloud, you might create multiple instances of an application to handle load balancing, redundancy, or scaling.

## Development

Organization wants to build a software -> hires 10 developers

Environment -> laptop/computer (config is very much imp) -> for computation and storage

1. All the supporting tools must be available also with required version<br>
   Creating this env for every dev will be hectic process

Alternative way to do this is to create virtual device

## EC2

Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, is a web service that provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It allows users to launch and manage virtual servers, known as instances, which can be configured with various operating systems, storage options, and networking capabilities. EC2 offers a flexible and cost-effective way to run applications in the cloud.

Through these EC2, we will be able to create virtual machines
