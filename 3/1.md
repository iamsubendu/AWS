## RDS (Relational Database Service)

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) is a fully managed, open-source cloud database service offered by AWS. It allows users to easily operate and scale their relational databases in the cloud. With RDS, users can set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the AWS Cloud, supporting popular database engines such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and Amazon Aurora.

<b>RDS provides a managed database service, which means that AWS handles the database administration tasks, such as patching, backups, and scaling, allowing users to focus on their applications and services.</b>

Any operation on the instance 1 wil be replicated to the replica instance instanteneously.

The replica instance will have only read access. We won't be able to modify anything from that instance.

We can create as many replica instance we want, and it will all work same
